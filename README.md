Definetly not a commandline downloader for https://gronkh.tv risen from the dead.

## Features

- Download [Stream-Episodes](https://gronkh.tv/streams/)
- Specify a start- and stop-timestamp to download only a portion of the video
- Download a specific chapter
- Continuable Downloads
- Show infos about that Episode

## Known Issues

- Downloads are capped to 10 Mbyte/s and buffering is simulated to pre-empt IP blocking due to API ratelimiting
- Start- and stop-timestamps are not very accurate (Â± 8 seconds)
- Some videoplayers may have problems with the resulting file. To fix this, you can use ffmpeg to rewrite the video into a MKV-File: `ffmpeg -i video.ts -acodec copy -vcodec copy video.mkv`
- Emojis and other Unicode characters don't get displayed properly in a Powershell Console

## Supported Platforms
